# 1.7 Louvain

The Louvain method is an algorithm to detect communities in large networks. It maximizes a modularity score for each community, where the modularity quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities. This means evaluating how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.

The Louvain algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm, that recursively merges communities into a single node and executes the modularity clustering on the condensed graphs.

The algorithm consists of the repeated application of two steps. The first step is a "greedy" assignment of nodes to communities, favoring local optimizations of modularity. The second step is the definition of a new coarse-grained network, based on the communities found in the first step. During this step nodes of the same community are merged into a single node, inheriting all connected relationships. These two steps are repeated until no further modularity-increasing reassignments of communities are possible. Because ties are broken arbitrarily, you can get different results between different runs of the Louvain algorithm.

The main drawback to Louvain is that it is significantly slower that Label Propagation and Weakly Connected Components, and the results can be hard to interpret. The algorithm is sensitive to the weighting scheme used on relationships. A good sign you need to tweak your schema or weighting is when you notice your results include only a *single* giant community, or every node is in itâ€™s own community of one.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

**Attention !** Running this algorithm requires sufficient memory availability. Before running this algorithm, estimate memory required for processing your graph.

#### Organisation of this tutorial section

The following is organised as follows. First we introduce the general syntax for using Louvain function in its different modes as this is possible in Neo4J, namely: 

- stream, stats, mutate on named graphs, 
- write mode on graphs in the catalogue, and 
- anonymous graphs.

Then the tutorial shows, through examples, the use of the Louvain function in its different modes through simple graphs. Finally, it proposes exercices based on the graph representing the content of the famous saga Game of Thrones.

## 1.7.3 Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

```cypher
CREATE (nAlice:User {name: 'Alice', seed: 42})
CREATE (nBridget:User {name: 'Bridget', seed: 42})
CREATE (nCharles:User {name: 'Charles', seed: 42})
CREATE (nDoug:User {name: 'Doug'})
CREATE (nMark:User {name: 'Mark'})
CREATE (nMichael:User {name: 'Michael'})

CREATE (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget)
CREATE (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nCharles)
CREATE (nCharles)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget)

CREATE (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 5}]->(nDoug)

CREATE (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nDoug)
CREATE (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMichael)
CREATE (nMichael)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMark);
```

This graph has two clusters of *Users*, that are closely connected. Between those clusters there is one single edge. The relationships that connect the nodes in each component have a property `weight` which determines the strength of the relationship.

We can now create the graph and store it in the graph catalog. We load the `LINK` relationships with orientation set to `UNDIRECTED` as this works best with the Louvain algorithm.

**The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.** 

```cypher
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'myGraph',
    'User',
    {
        LINK: {
            orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
        }
    },
    {
        nodeProperties: 'seed',
        relationshipProperties: 'weight'
    }
)
```

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Louvain algorithm on this graph.

#### 1.7.3.1 Memory estimation

First off, we will estimate the cost of running the algorithm using the `estimate` procedure. This can be done with any execution mode. We will use the `write` mode in this example. Estimating the algorithm is useful to understand the memory impact that running the algorithm on your graph will have. When you later actually run the algorithm in one of the execution modes the system will perform an estimation. If the estimation shows that there is a very high probability of the execution going over its memory limitations, the execution is prohibited.

**The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm:** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.write.estimate('myGraph', { writeProperty: 'community' })
YIELD nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
```

#### Results

| nodeCount | relationshipCount | bytesMin | bytesMax | requiredMemory             |
| :-------- | :---------------- | :------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| 6         | 14                | 5321     | 580088   | "[5321 Bytes ... 566 KiB]" |

#### 1.7.3.2 Stream

In the `stream` execution mode, the algorithm returns the community ID for each node. This allows us to inspect the results directly or post-process them in Cypher without any side effects. For example, we can order the results to find the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality.

**The following will run the algorithm and stream results:** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
ORDER BY name ASC
```

#### Results

| name      | communityId | intermediateCommunityIds |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------------- |
| "Alice"   | 2           | null                     |
| "Bridget" | 2           | null                     |
| "Charles" | 2           | null                     |
| "Doug"    | 5           | null                     |
| "Mark"    | 5           | null                     |
| "Michael" | 5           | null                     |



We use default values for the procedure configuration parameter. Levels and `innerIterations` are set to 10 and the tolerance value is 0.0001. Because we did not set the value of `includeIntermediateCommunities` to `true`, the column communities is always `null`.

#### 1.7.3.3 Stats

In the `stats` execution mode, the algorithm returns a single row containing a summary of the algorithm result. In particular, Betweenness Centrality returns the minimum, maximum and sum of all centrality scores. This execution mode does not have any side effects. It can be useful for evaluating algorithm performance by inspecting the `computeMillis`return item. In the examples below we will omit returning the timings. 

**The following will run the algorithm and returns the result in form of statistical and measurement values.** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stats('myGraph')
YIELD communityCount
```

#### Results

| communityCount |
| :------------- |
| 2              |

#### 1.7.3.4 Mutate

The `mutate` execution mode extends the `stats` mode with an important side effect: updating the named graph with a new node property containing the community ID for that node. The name of the new property is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `mutateProperty`. The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics. The `mutate` mode is especially useful when multiple algorithms are used in conjunction.

**The following will run the algorithm and store the results in `myGraph`:** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.mutate('myGraph', { mutateProperty: 'communityId' })
YIELD communityCount, modularity, modularities
```

#### Results

| communityCount | modularity         | modularities         |
| :------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- |
| 2              | 0.3571428571428571 | [0.3571428571428571] |

In `mutate` mode, only a single row is returned by the procedure. The result contains meta information, like the number of identified communities and the modularity values. In contrast to the `write` mode the result is written to the GDS in-memory graph instead of the Neo4j database.

#### 1.7.3.5 Write

The `write` execution mode extends the `stats` mode with an important side effect: writing the community ID for each node as a property to the Neo4j database. The name of the new property is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeProperty`. The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics. The `write` mode enables directly persisting the results to the database.

**The following run the algorithm, and write back results:** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.write('myGraph', { writeProperty: 'community' })
YIELD communityCount, modularity, modularities
```

#### Results

| communityCount | modularity         | modularities         |
| :------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- |
| 2              | 0.3571428571428571 | [0.3571428571428571] |

When writing back the results, only a single row is returned by the procedure. The result contains meta information, like the number of identified communities and the modularity values.

#### 1.7.3.6 Weighted

The Louvain algorithm can also run on weighted graphs, taking the given relationship weights into concern when calculating the modularity.



**The following will run the algorithm on a weighted graph and stream results:** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
ORDER BY name ASC
```

#### Results

| name      | communityId | intermediateCommunityIds |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------------- |
| "Alice"   | 3           | null                     |
| "Bridget" | 2           | null                     |
| "Charles" | 2           | null                     |
| "Doug"    | 3           | null                     |
| "Mark"    | 5           | null                     |
| "Michael" | 5           | null                     |

Using the weighted relationships, we see that `Alice` and `Doug` have formed their own community, as their link is much stronger than all the others.

#### 1.7.3.7 Seeded

The Louvain algorithm can be run incrementally, by providing a seed property. With the seed property an initial community mapping can be supplied for a subset of the loaded nodes. The algorithm will try to keep the seeded community IDs.

**The following will run the algorithm and stream results:** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraph', { seedProperty: 'seed' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
ORDER BY name ASC
```

#### Results

| name      | communityId | intermediateCommunityIds |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------------- |
| "Alice"   | 42          | null                     |
| "Bridget" | 42          | null                     |
| "Charles" | 42          | null                     |
| "Doug"    | 47          | null                     |
| "Mark"    | 47          | null                     |
| "Michael" | 47          | null                     |

Using the seeded graph, we see that the community around `Alice` keeps its initial community ID of `42`. The other community is assigned a new community ID, which is guaranteed to be larger than the largest seeded community ID. Note that the `consecutiveIds` configuration option cannot be used in combination with seeding in order to retain the seeding values.

#### 1.7.3.8 Stream intermediate communities

As described before, Louvain is a hierarchical clustering algorithm. That means that after every clustering step all nodes that belong to the same cluster are reduced to a single node. Relationships between nodes of the same cluster become self-relationships, relationships to nodes of other clusters connect to the clusters representative. This condensed graph is then used to run the next level of clustering. The process is repeated until the clusters are stable.

In order to demonstrate this iterative behavior, we need to construct a more complex graph.

CREATE (j)-[:TYPE]->(n)
CREATE (k)-[:TYPE]->(m)
CREATE (k)-[:TYPE]->(l)
CREATE (l)-[:TYPE]->(n)
CREATE (m)-[:TYPE]->(n);
```

**The following will load the example graph, run the algorithm and stream results including the intermediate communities:** 

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream({
    nodeProjection: 'Node',
    relationshipProjection: {
        TYPE: {
            type: 'TYPE',
            orientation: 'undirected',
            aggregation: 'NONE'
        }
    },
    includeIntermediateCommunities: true
}) YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
ORDER BY name ASC
```

#### Results

| name | communityId | intermediateCommunityIds |
| :--- | :---------- | :----------------------- |
| "a"  | 14          | [3, 14]                  |
| "b"  | 14          | [3, 14]                  |
| "c"  | 14          | [14, 14]                 |
| "d"  | 14          | [3, 14]                  |
| "e"  | 14          | [14, 14]                 |
| "f"  | 14          | [14, 14]                 |
| "g"  | 7           | [7, 7]                   |
| "h"  | 7           | [7, 7]                   |
| "i"  | 7           | [7, 7]                   |
| "j"  | 12          | [12, 12]                 |
| "k"  | 12          | [12, 12]                 |
| "l"  | 12          | [12, 12]                 |
| "m"  | 12          | [12, 12]                 |
| "n"  | 12          | [12, 12]                 |
| "x"  | 14          | [14, 14]                 |

In this example graph, after the first iteration we see 4 clusters, which in the second iteration are reduced to three.

## 1.7.4 Exercise

We will compute the Louvain community structure of our pre-loaded graph.

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream('got-interactions')
YIELD nodeId, communityId
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS person, communityId
ORDER BY communityId DESC
```

The above query returns the name of the `Person` and the `community ID` they belongs to. If we want to investigate how many communities there are, and how many members there are in each community we can change the RETURN statement:

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream('got-interactions')
YIELD nodeId, communityId
RETURN communityId, COUNT(DISTINCT nodeId) AS members
ORDER BY members DESC
```

We can see that there are 1382 communities - 11 with more than one member.

### Louvain: weighting

The Louvain algorithm can also run on weighted graphs, taking the given relationship weights into concern when calculating the modularity.

Before we continue we need a graph that was created with the `weight` relationship property.

```cypher
CALL gds.graph.create(
  'got-weighted-interactions',
  'Person',
  {
    INTERACTS: {
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED',
      aggregation: 'NONE',
      properties: {
      	weight: {
          property: 'weight',
          aggregation: 'NONE',
          defaultValue: 0.0
        }
      }
    }
  }
)
```

If a relationship doesnâ€™t have a `weight` property the number specified in `defaultValue` will be used as a fallback.

We can then use the 'weight' property on the INTERACTS relationship and see what happens:

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream(
  'got-weighted-interactions',
  {
    relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight'
  }
)
YIELD nodeId, communityId
RETURN communityId, COUNT(DISTINCT nodeId) AS members
ORDER BY members DESC
```

This gives us 1384 communities, 13 with more than one member.

### Louvain: intermediate communities

One of the cool things about Louvain is that it is hierarchical clustering algorithm. It identifies communities at multiple levels in the graph: first smaller communities, that then combine to form larger ones.

To retrieve the intermediate communities, you can simple set `includeIntermediateCommunities: true`:

```
CALL gds.louvain.stream(
  'got-interactions',
  {
    includeIntermediateCommunities: true
  }
)
YIELD nodeId, communityId, communityIds
RETURN communityId, COUNT(DISTINCT nodeId) AS members, communityIds as intermediateCommunities
```

We can extract membership in different levels of communities and see how the composition changes:

```cypher
CALL gds.louvain.stream(
  'got-interactions',
  {
    includeIntermediateCommunities: true
  }
)
YIELD nodeId, communityIds
RETURN count(distinct communityIds[0]), count(distinct communityIds[1])
includeIntermediateCommunities: false` is the default value, in this case the `communityIds` field of the result is `null
```

Can you identify nodes that belong to different communities in the first level of hierarchy, but combine to the same community in the next level?

### Louvain: cleanup

To clean up the in-memory graph created during the Louvain exercise you can run the following query

```cypher
CALL gds.graph.drop('got-weighted-interactions');
```
